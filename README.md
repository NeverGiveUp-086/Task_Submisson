I have created a simple React app using TypeScript. Users can log in or sign up, search, and view details on  a dashboard. Use Redux Toolkit to manage the app's data and make sure to handle things like  updates and user authentication in a way that's easy for beginners to understand. The app should  have four main screens: Login, Signup, Dashboard.
